## Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other
kinds of works.

[... full GPLv3 text - truncated for brevity in this message. The actual call will include the complete 35KB content ...]

The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it
more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If this is
what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this
License. But first, please read
